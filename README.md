Hi I'm Trent, and I'll be going over this tutorial on Network Programming in Swingame

**NOTE:** I would not reccomend using SwinGame for this. It is a horrible idea and you will spend more time swearing at SwinGame than seeing results.


## Step 1: Setting up your environment
Getting into it, before you can do good code, need to get the development environment setup.

For this project, its actually two seperate programs, thus two environments. The Server program, and the Client program, but they have identical setup, just have to remember that two will exist.

For this, I will be using Visual Studio Code, because having a text editor capable of intellisense is super handy for this, and will be using MinGW GCC / GDB for compiling and debugging (Visual Studio Code supports GDB).

For VSCode, I will be using the official C/C++ Extension from Microsoft which does the language services, and manages GDB debugging.

So, first things first, gotta make a folder for the client and server, I will be referring to these as `Project_Client` and `Project_Server`.
